/**
 * Supply-chain hygiene guards.
 *
 * The project standardized on pnpm (`packageManager` in package.json) and every CI
 * workflow installs with `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`. A stale, committed
 * `package-lock.json` used to shadow the pnpm tree and roughly doubled the Dependabot
 * alert surface — each advisory was counted once per ecosystem, and the npm lockfile
 * even pinned phantom dependencies (e.g. a root `axios`) that were not in package.json
 * at all. Removing it left pnpm-lock.yaml as the single source of truth.
 *
 * These guards fail loudly if a second lockfile or a non-pnpm package manager is
 * reintroduced, so that single-source-of-truth invariant cannot silently regress.
